      PAW Patrol is a Canadian CGI–animated children's television series created
      by Keith Chapman (also the creator of Bob the Builder). It is produced by
      Spin Master Entertainment, with animation provided by Guru Studio. In
      Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOKids, which first ran
      previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on Nickelodeon
      in the United States on August 12, 2013. The series focuses on a young boy
      named Ryder who leads a crew of search and rescue dogs that call
      themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the
      shoreside community of Adventure Bay and surrounding areas. Each dog has a
      specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a
      firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in
      doghouses that transform into customized vehicles, or “pupmobiles, ” for
      their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called "pup packs"
      that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.
